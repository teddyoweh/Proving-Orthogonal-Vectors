# Proving Orthogonal ( Perpendicular) Vectors
 A function created to parse two vector and follow an alogrithm to prove if the vectors are  Orthogonal ( Perpendicular)  or not.

 # Function Name | IsOrthogonal(u,v)
 Prints out a bool ( True or False) after performing an algorithmn operation on the vectors entered.
 u and v are the arguments to be parsed for the algorithm to operate on.
 u and v are vectors and should be in a comma seperated string

 eg: 
 vector1 = '3,4'
 vector2 = '-8,6'
 IsOrthogonal(vector1,vector2)
 ## Or 
 IsOrthogonal('3,4','-8,6')
